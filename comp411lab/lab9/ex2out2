A puppy couldn't sleep, so her mother told a story about a little frog,
  who couldn't sleep, so the frog's mother told a story about a little bear,
    who couldn't sleep, so the bear's mother told a story about a little weasel,
      who couldn't sleep, so the weasel's mother told a story about a little joey,
        who couldn't sleep, so the joey's mother told a story about a little kitten,
          ... who fell asleep.
        ... and then the little joey fell asleep;
      ... and then the little weasel fell asleep;
    ... and then the little bear fell asleep;
  ... and then the little frog fell asleep;
... and then the puppy fell asleep.
