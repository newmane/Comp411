A child couldn't sleep, so her mother told a story about a little frog,
  who couldn't sleep, so the frog's mother told a story about a little bear,
    who couldn't sleep, so the bear's mother told a story about a little weasel,
      ... who fell asleep.
    ... and then the little bear fell asleep;
  ... and then the little frog fell asleep;
... and then the child fell asleep.
